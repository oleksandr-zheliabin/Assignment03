// The “Coin Flip” Game Redux

// In this part of the assignment you will explore what you’ve learned so far about variables, for loops, conditionals, operators, math, 
// and more to create a different version of the “coin flip game”.

// To complete the game follow the steps outlined below:

// 1) Begin your application by declaring a variable called coinFlip. Do not assign the variable a number just yet.
// 2) Create a for loop that loops a certain amount of times. 
// The amount of times that the for loop executes will be collected from the user via a prompt.
// 3) Within the for loop assign a randomly generated number to You will have to use the same Math formula 
// that you used in the previous assignment to get this number.
// 4) Use a conditional statement to check the result of the coin flip. If it’s 0, write out “Heads” into the console window. 
// If it’s 1, write out “Tails” into the console window.

// Note: Unlike the previous assignment, you’re not prompting the user for their choice. 
// You’re simply displaying the coin flip results in the console.

let coinFlip
let number = parseInt(prompt('Please, enter the number of coin flips:'))

for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {

    let coinFlip = Math.round(Math.random())
    if (coinFlip == 0) {

        console.log(i +' - Heads')

    } else {

        console.log(i + ' - Tails')
    }
}
